#%% Definition of Python classes that constitute the model architecture
'''
The code is based on two concatenated python classes, namely 'User' and
'Appliance', which are used to define at the outer level the User classes and
at the inner level all the available appliances within each user class, with
their own characteristics. Within the Appliance class, some other functions are
created to define windows of use and, if needed, specific duty cycles
